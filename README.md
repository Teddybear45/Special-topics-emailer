# Special-topics-emailer

# Abstract
A browser and/or standalone app which detects tone, formality, and length of email to suggest an appropriate closing for the email.

# Potential Scope
Oftentimes, we want to mimic the tone of the email sent to us in our response. Therefore, we  could also extend the project’s scope to categorize and let the user know of the tone certain senders generally employ. From this, the program could suggest modifications to better mimic the sender’s tone.

# Goals
- Differentiate formal and informal tones using an NLP library 
- Create a chrome web extension for the gmail app
- Substitute words based on your proposed tone
- Store the usual tones of senders
- Let the user know the tone, based on a developed score or value, of the email
